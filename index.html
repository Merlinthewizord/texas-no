              The al-Qassam armed wing of Palestinian militant group Hamas said it launched hundreds of missiles at the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, saying the attack was ‚Äúin response to the displacement of civilians.‚Äù
              Israel continues its airstrikes all over the enclosed territory of Gaza, and has ordered the complete cutting of water, electricity and food to the already impoverished and blockaded population of roughly 2.3 million people.

Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, said it has some 150 Israeli hostages in captivity. The U.S. and other governments are working to determine the number of foreign hostages in Hamas‚Äô captivity.
